			briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditianally used as a 
			herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h3>Breed History</h3>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for
			centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
			sentries, messengers and to seach for wounded soilders because of its fine sense 
			of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of 
			extenction. Currently the population of brairds is slowly recovering. 
			Charlemagne, Napolean, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
